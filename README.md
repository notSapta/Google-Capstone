# Google-Capstone
Google advanced data analytics capstone project where a certain company, Salifort motors is facing high employee retention - we are to analyze the dataset and find reasons along with predicting future Employee retention. The code environment is Google Colab because the Coursera Jupyter Notebook was unable to import Tensorflow. Even though the Google Capstone guides us to build a regression or tree models (Machine learning), we chose to implement a Deep learning model using tensorflow as we have already compared all the machine learning algorithms in our previous project "BANK CHURNERS" which also has similar use case.
